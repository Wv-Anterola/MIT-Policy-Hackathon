# Federal Framework Recommendations for Youth Online Safety

*Data-Driven Policy Recommendations from State Legislative Analysis*

---

## Uniform Standards

**Uniform Federal Standards** (High Consensus Areas):
- Age Verification Requirements: Standardize methods and privacy protections
- Data Privacy Baseline: Minimum protections for minors' personal data
- Platform Duty of Care: Clear liability framework for negligent harm
- Transparency Requirements: Standardized reporting on safety measures

**Rationale**: These provisions appear in majority of state laws, indicating broad consensus.

## State Flexibility

**State Flexibility Areas** (Local Context Matters):
- Content Moderation Standards: Reflect local community values
- Educational Requirements: Align with state curricula
- Enforcement Mechanisms: Leverage existing state agencies
- Implementation Timelines: Consider state resource availability

**Rationale**: Geographic and cultural variation requires local adaptation.

## Preemption Policy

**Preemption Framework** (Floor, Not Ceiling):
- Federal law establishes minimum protections (floor)
- States may exceed federal standards (ceiling) in specific areas
- Uniform standards for interstate platforms (prevent fragmentation)
- State autonomy for local education and enforcement

**Rationale**: Balance national consistency with state innovation.

## Implementation

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Phase 1 (Year 1): Large platforms (>10M users)
- Phase 2 (Year 2): Medium platforms (1-10M users)
- Phase 3 (Year 3): Small platforms (<1M users)
- Graduated compliance support for smaller entities
- Federal-state coordination mechanism

**Support Mechanisms**:
- Technical assistance from FTC/NTIA
- Safe harbor for good-faith compliance
- Regular review and adaptation process
- Multi-stakeholder advisory council
