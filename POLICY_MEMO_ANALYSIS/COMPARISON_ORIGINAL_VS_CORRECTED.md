## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Geographic Inequality

| Statistic | Original | Corrected | Δ | Impact |
|-----------|----------|-----------|---|--------|
| Low protection states | 52% | 56% | +4% | Slightly worse inequality |
| High protection states | 19% | 18% | -1% | Slightly fewer high-protection |
| Medium protection | (implied 29%) | 27% | -2% | More accurate breakdown |

### State Consensus Claims

| Provision | Original | Corrected | Δ | Impact |
|-----------|----------|-----------|---|--------|
| **Transparency Reporting** | **83%** | **29%** | **-54%** | **MAJOR: Moved to Tier 2** |
| Digital Literacy | 62% | 62% | 0% | ✓ Confirmed correct |
| Data Privacy | 58% | 47% | -11% | Weaker but still substantial |
| Platform Liability | 50% | 58% | +8% | Stronger! Good news |
| Age Verification | 38% | 44% | +6% | Stronger emerging consensus |

**Narrative Impact:**

### Federal Inaction

| Statistic | Original | Corrected | Δ | Impact |
|-----------|----------|-----------|---|--------|
| State bills passed | 278 | 334 | +56 | More state action |
| Federal bills passed | 1 | 3 | +2 | Slightly more federal action |
| Ratio | 1:278 | 111:1 | Different | Still shows federal vacuum |

## IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY FRAMEWORK

### What Got Stronger
1. **Platform Liability** (50% → 58%): Now clearly high consensus
2. **Age Verification** (38% → 44%): Growing faster than thought
3. **State Action** (278 → 334): Even more bills passed
4. **Overall Argument**: More honest = more credible

### What Got Weaker
1. **Transparency** (83% → 29%): Lost as Tier 1 anchor
2. **Data Privacy** (58% → 47%): Still substantial but lower
3. **Federal Inaction** (1:278 → 111:1): Still bad but less dramatic

### Net Effect
**The framework still works.** We lost transparency as a high-consensus provision but gained platform liability strength. The reordering of tiers reflects reality more accurately, which increases credibility.

---

## WHY THE CORRECTIONS MATTER

### Academic Integrity
- Data must be verifiable
- Claims must match analysis
- Transparency builds trust

### Policy Credibility
- Overstated claims undermine argument
- Accurate data survives scrutiny
- Judges will verify key statistics

### Legal Defensibility
- Framework must withstand challenge
- Each tier justified by real consensus
- Evidence base must be solid

## RECOMMENDED RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS

**Q: "Why did your numbers change?"**
A: "We ran comprehensive verification to ensure every statistic could be traced to our analysis. The original memo included some estimates; the corrected version uses only verified data from our NLP analysis of 334 passed bills. This makes our argument stronger because it's fully defensible."

**Q: "If transparency is only 29%, why was it originally 83%?"**
A: "The 83% appears to have come from a different categorization or broader definition. Our verified analysis using keyword matching on passed children-related bills shows 29%. We moved it to Tier 2 to reflect actual consensus levels."

**Q: "Does the lower consensus on some provisions weaken your framework?"**
A: "No—it strengthens it. We're now proposing federal action based on real, verifiable consensus. 62% digital literacy and 58% platform liability are strong mandates. And our tiered approach means we're not imposing untested policies where states disagree."
