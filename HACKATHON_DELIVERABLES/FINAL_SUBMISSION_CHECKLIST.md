## 🎤 KEY TALKING POINTS (MEMORIZE)

### The Opening Hook
> "52% of American children live in states with minimal online safety protections, while only 19% benefit from comprehensive safeguards. We analyzed 7,938 bills and found your child's digital safety depends on their zip code."

### The Discovery Moment
> "We think partisan gridlock means no consensus. We found the opposite. 81% of states agree on platform liability. 64% mandate education. 58% require age verification. The consensus exists—federal leadership has been absent."

### The Solution in One Sentence
> "A 3-tier federal framework: uniform standards where states agree, flexibility where they diverge, experimentation where they differ—data-driven federalism."

### The Closing Question
> "We have the data. We have the consensus. We have the solution. The only question: Do we have the will?"

### The 5 Numbers That Win
1. **52%** - Low protection states (equity)
2. **1:278** - Federal-to-state bill ratio (viability/urgency)
3. **81%** - Platform liability consensus (originality/hidden agreement)
4. **95%** - Evidence gap (technicality/data need)
5. **671** - Bills in 2025 (momentum/political readiness)

4. **Support with data** (cite specific numbers)
5. **Connect to framework** ("This is why Tier 2 includes...")

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**:
- ❌ Don't get defensive about criticism
- ❌ Don't BS if you don't know ("We'd need to research that")
- ❌ Don't argue with judges (stay respectful)
- ❌ Don't ramble (35-second response structure)
