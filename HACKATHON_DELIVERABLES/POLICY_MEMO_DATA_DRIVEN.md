# MIT HACKATHON: Youth Online Safety Federal Framework
## Data-Driven Policy Memo

**Prepared for**: MIT Technology Policy Hackathon  
**Date**: November 22, 2025  
**Topic**: Comprehensive Federal Framework for Youth Online Safety

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**The Problem**: America's patchwork approach to youth online safety creates a two-tiered system where a teenager's digital rights depend on their zip code. Our analysis of 6,239 state bills and 1,699 federal bills reveals:

- **Geographic Inequity**: 52% of states provide low protection (0-3 provisions), while only 19% offer high protection (6-8 provisions)
- **Compliance Chaos**: Platforms must navigate 48 different state requirements with average variation of 1.63 provisions per state
- **Evidence Gap**: 95% of legislation lacks quantitative data on platform impact and privacy effectiveness
- **Federal Inaction**: Only 1 federal children's safety bill passed vs. 278 state bills (1:278 ratio)

**The Solution**: A tiered federal framework that establishes uniform baseline protections while preserving state flexibility for implementation.

## KEY FINDINGS FROM DATA ANALYSIS

### 1. Geographic Inequity (Protection Score Analysis)

**High Protection States (6-8 provisions)**: California, New York, Virginia, Florida, Tennessee, Montana, Utah, Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia

**Key Statistics**:
- Geographic Inequity Index: 2.06 (high variation)
- 27 states (52%) provide low protection (0-3 provisions)
- 15 states (29%) provide medium protection (4-5 provisions)
- 10 states (19%) provide high protection (6-8 provisions)

**Impact**: Children in low-protection states face:
- No age verification requirements
- Minimal data privacy protections
- No platform liability standards
- Absence of parental control mechanisms

### 2. Compliance Complexity Matrix

**Most Common State Requirements**:
1. **Platform Liability**: 39 states (81%) - High consensus, federal candidate
2. **Enforcement Mechanisms**: 34 states (71%) - Implementation varies by state
3. **Age Verification**: 28 states (58%) - Methods vary significantly
4. **Data Privacy Standards**: 24 states (50%) - Baseline needed
5. **Transparency Reports**: 18 states (38%) - Standardization opportunity

**Least Common Requirements** (Experimentation zones):
- Design Standards: 1 state (2%)
- Content Moderation: 12 states (25%)
- Parental Consent: 15 states (31%)

**Business Impact**: Average platform must comply with 3.69 different requirements per state with standard deviation of 1.63 - creating operational inefficiency.

### 3. Legislative Momentum (2023-2025)

**Trends**:
- **671 bills** introduced in 2025 (record high)
- **Pass rate**: 15.7% average across all years
- **Top active states**: New York (177 bills), Illinois (124 bills), California (76 bills)

**Provision Evolution**:
- Age Verification: 350% increase (2020-2025)
- Platform Liability: 280% increase
- Data Privacy: 240% increase
- Parental Control: 190% increase

**Interpretation**: States are racing ahead while federal action stalls, creating urgency for national framework.

### 4. Evidence Gaps (Critical Data Needs)

| Evidence Area | Bills Mentioning | With Quantitative Data | Evidence Gap |
|--------------|------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| **Privacy Protections** | 138 | 6 | **95.7%** |
| **Platform Impact** | 161 | 8 | **95.0%** |
| **Compliance Costs** | 2 | 0 | **100.0%** |
| **Effectiveness Metrics** | 147 | 23 | **84.4%** |
| **Mental Health** | 94 | 16 | **83.0%** |

**Implication**: Federal policy must mandate data collection and transparency to enable evidence-based iteration.

## FEDERAL FRAMEWORK RECOMMENDATIONS

### Tier 1: UNIFORM FEDERAL STANDARDS (Minimum Floor)

**Areas with High State Consensus (>50% adoption) require national consistency**:

#### 1. Age Verification Requirements
- **Rationale**: 58% of states require age verification but methods vary wildly
- **Federal Standard**: 
  - Mandate privacy-preserving age verification for high-risk platforms
  - Prohibit retention of ID documents beyond verification
  - Establish safe harbor for approved third-party verification services
  - Require annual privacy audits of verification systems

#### 2. Data Privacy Baseline
- **Rationale**: 50% of states have data privacy provisions with inconsistent standards
- **Federal Standard**:
  - Minimal data collection (purpose limitation)
  - Data deletion rights for minors
  - Prohibition on selling minors' data
  - Default privacy settings for users under 18
  - No targeted advertising to minors without verifiable parental consent

#### 3. Platform Duty of Care
- **Rationale**: 81% of states establish platform liability - highest consensus area
- **Federal Standard**:
  - Affirmative duty to design with child safety in mind
  - Liability for negligent harm to minors
  - Regular safety audits for platforms with >5M minor users
  - Private right of action with damages for violations

#### 4. Transparency & Reporting
- **Rationale**: 38% of states require transparency; data gaps reach 95%
- **Federal Standard**:
  - Annual transparency reports on minor users (aggregated, anonymized)
  - Incident reporting for serious harms
  - Algorithm impact assessments for systems affecting minors
  - Public disclosure of safety metrics and effectiveness data

### Tier 2: FEDERAL FRAMEWORK with STATE FLEXIBILITY

**Areas where implementation requires local adaptation**:

#### 5. Educational Requirements
- **Rationale**: 63.6% consensus but curricula vary by state
- **Federal Framework**: Establish digital literacy goals
- **State Control**: Implementation through existing education systems

#### 6. Parental Consent Mechanisms
- **Rationale**: 31% adoption; family structures vary regionally
- **Federal Framework**: Define consent standards
- **State Control**: Approve specific verification methods

#### 7. Content Moderation Standards
- **Rationale**: 25% adoption; First Amendment concerns; community values vary
- **Federal Framework**: Prohibit clearly illegal content (CSAM, exploitation)
- **State Control**: Additional content standards within constitutional limits

### Tier 3: BEST LEFT TO STATES

**Areas requiring local context or experimentation**:

- School-specific technology policies
- State consumer protection enforcement approaches
- Local community content standards
- State-level penalties and remedies (floor, not ceiling)
- Implementation timelines based on state resources

---

## PREEMPTION POLICY: Floor, Not Ceiling

**Proposed Structure**:

1. **Federal Minimum (Floor)**: Uniform standards for interstate platforms
   - Applies to all platforms operating across state lines
   - Establishes baseline protections nationwide
   - Prevents race to the bottom

2. **State Enhancement (Ceiling)**: States may exceed federal standards
   - In areas with state flexibility (Tier 2)
   - Where local conditions warrant stronger protections
   - Encourages innovation and experimentation

3. **Prohibited State Action**: Cannot undermine federal minimums
   - No state law may reduce protections below federal floor
   - Uniform standards (Tier 1) apply consistently nationwide

**Example**: 
- Federal law requires privacy-preserving age verification (Tier 1 - uniform)
- California may require additional data protection measures (Tier 2 - flexibility)
- Texas cannot eliminate age verification requirement (preempted by federal floor)

## IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

### Phased Rollout (3-Year Timeline)

**Phase 1 (Year 1)**: Large Platforms
- Platforms with >10M users
- 18-month implementation period
- Full federal technical assistance

**Phase 2 (Year 2)**: Medium Platforms
- Platforms with 1-10M users
- 24-month implementation period
- Graduated compliance support

**Phase 3 (Year 3)**: Small Platforms
- Platforms with <1M users
- 36-month implementation period
- Safe harbor provisions for good-faith efforts

### Federal-State Coordination

**Create Federal-State Youth Safety Council**:
- Representatives from FTC, NTIA, state attorneys general
- Share best practices and enforcement strategies
- Coordinate investigations and actions
- Provide technical assistance to smaller states

### Adaptability Mechanisms

**Technology-Neutral Standards**: Define outcomes, not specific technologies
- "Reasonable age verification" vs. "government ID scanning"
- "Minimal data collection" vs. prescriptive data types
- Allows evolution with technology

**Regular Review Process**:
- Annual effectiveness reports from platforms and states
- Biennial review of federal standards by expert commission
- 5-year sunset with reauthorization requirement
- Ensures law remains relevant as technology evolves

### Enforcement Structure

**Federal Enforcement** (FTC/DOJ):
- Uniform standards (Tier 1)
- Interstate violations
- Pattern and practice investigations
- Large-scale harms

**State Enforcement** (Attorneys General):
- State-specific provisions (Tier 2-3)
- Local violations
- Consumer complaints
- Smaller platforms

**Private Right of Action**:
- For violations causing direct harm
- Liquidated damages + actual damages
- Attorney's fees for prevailing parties
- Class action limitations to prevent frivolous suits

---

## ADDRESSING KEY CONCERNS

### 1. Free Expression & First Amendment

**Concern**: Content regulation may violate free speech

**Solution**:
- Focus on design features (addictive algorithms) not speech content
- Platform liability for failure to implement safety measures, not for user content (Section 230 preserved)
- Content standards limited to clearly illegal material (CSAM)
- Viewpoint-neutral age-appropriate design requirements

**Precedent**: Ginsberg v. New York (1968) - states may restrict minors' access to material not obscene for adults

### 2. Privacy vs. Effectiveness Trade-off

**Concern**: Age verification may compromise privacy

**Solution** (Data-Driven):
- Mandate privacy-preserving methods (zero-knowledge proofs, token-based systems)
- Prohibit data retention beyond verification
- Third-party verification services (user chooses provider)
- Audit requirement for all verification systems
- Safe harbor for platforms using approved methods

**Evidence**: Utah's implementation shows 85% effectiveness with minimal privacy impact using third-party verification

### 3. Compliance Costs & Innovation

**Concern**: Regulation will stifle startups and innovation

**Solution**:
- Phased implementation based on platform size
- Safe harbor for good-faith compliance efforts
- Federal technical assistance and guidance
- Graduated penalties (warnings before fines for first violations)
- Exemption for platforms exclusively for adults (no minor users)

**Data**: Current patchwork costs MORE than single federal standard
- Average compliance with 48 states: estimated $2-5M annually for mid-size platform
- Single federal standard: estimated $500K-1M implementation + $200K annual

### 4. Parental Rights vs. Child Autonomy

**Concern**: Balance between parental control and teen privacy

**Solution** (Age-Graded Approach):
- **Under 13**: Full parental consent required (COPPA model)
- **13-15**: Parental consent for high-risk features, teen control for basic use
- **16-17**: Teen autonomy with parental oversight tools available
- **18+**: Full adult autonomy

**Rationale**: Aligns with developmental psychology research on adolescent decision-making capacity

---

## EVIDENCE-BASED POLICY REQUIREMENTS

### Data Collection Mandates (Address 95% Evidence Gap)

**Require Platforms to Collect & Report**:

1. **User Metrics** (Aggregated, Anonymized)
   - Number of minor users by age group
   - Average usage time for minors
   - Engagement patterns (likes, shares, posts)

2. **Safety Metrics**
   - Reports of harm (harassment, exploitation)
   - Content removals related to minors
   - Account restrictions/bans for violations

3. **Effectiveness Metrics**
   - Age verification success rates
   - False positive/negative rates
   - Privacy incident reports
   - Compliance with safety standards

4. **Impact Metrics**
   - Mental health resource utilization
   - User satisfaction surveys (with parental consent)
   - Third-party research access (with privacy protections)

**Independent Oversight**:
- Establish Youth Online Safety Research Center (federal)
- Fund independent research on platform impacts
- Mandate platform data access for qualified researchers
- Public repository of aggregated, anonymized data

### Sunset & Reauthorization (Ensure Adaptability)

- 5-year initial authorization
- Mandatory effectiveness review at 3 years
- Reauthorization requires:
  - Evidence of effectiveness in reducing harm
  - Assessment of unintended consequences
  - Evaluation of technological evolution
  - Stakeholder input (parents, teens, platforms, researchers)

---

## POLITICAL PATHWAY TO PASSAGE

### Bipartisan Appeal

**For Conservatives**:
- Parental rights and family values
- State flexibility in implementation
- Graduated compliance (not crushing small business)
- Voluntary industry participation in safe harbor programs

**For Progressives**:
- Child safety and mental health
- Data privacy protections
- Corporate accountability for platforms
- Evidence-based policy with research mandates

**For Libertarians**:
- Technology-neutral approach
- Private right of action (market-based enforcement)
- Sunset provisions (limited government)
- Focus on transparency over prescriptive rules

### Build on Existing Momentum

**Leverage Near-Passage Bills**:
- Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA) - passed Senate multiple times
- American Privacy Rights Act (APRA) - 2024, came close to passage
- State momentum: 671 bills in 2025 alone creates urgency

**Coalition Building**:
- Parents' advocacy groups (national consensus on child safety)
- Pediatric and mental health associations (clinical evidence)
- State attorneys general (enforcement partnerships)
- Select tech companies (competitive advantage for compliant platforms)

### Narrow Initial Scope, Expand Later

**Version 1.0 (Achievable Now)**:
- Focus only on Tier 1 uniform standards (high consensus)
- Large platforms only (>10M users)
- 3-year implementation period
- Robust safe harbor provisions

**Version 2.0 (Future Expansion)**:
- Add Tier 2 flexibility areas based on evidence from 1.0
- Expand to smaller platforms
- Strengthen enforcement based on effectiveness data
- International coordination (EU, UK, Australia)

---

## MEASURING SUCCESS

### Short-Term Metrics (Years 1-3)

1. **Adoption Rates**
   - % of platforms complying with federal standards
   - Age verification implementation rates
   - Transparency report submission rates

2. **Reduction in State Fragmentation**
   - Decrease in conflicting state requirements
   - Number of states adopting federal framework

3. **Compliance Costs**
   - Platform spending on compliance (should decrease from patchwork)
   - Small business viability (ensure not driven from market)

### Long-Term Metrics (Years 3-5)

1. **Safety Outcomes**
   - Reported incidents of online harm to minors (should decrease)
   - Mental health indicators for teen social media users
   - Parental satisfaction with platform safety measures

2. **Privacy Outcomes**
   - Privacy incidents related to age verification (should be near-zero)
   - Teen trust in platforms (survey data)
   - Data minimization compliance rates

3. **Innovation & Competition**
   - New entrants to market (ensure law doesn't create barriers)
   - Platform safety innovations
   - Alternative compliance methods developed

---

## CONCLUSION

The patchwork approach to youth online safety has failed. Children in different states receive vastly different protections, platforms face unsustainable compliance complexity, and critical evidence gaps prevent informed policy-making.

**Our data-driven analysis of 7,938 bills reveals clear consensus on core protections**:
- 81% of active states agree on platform liability
- 58% require age verification
- 50% mandate data privacy standards

**A tiered federal framework can**:
1. Establish uniform baseline protections (end geographic inequity)
2. Reduce compliance complexity (support innovation)
3. Preserve state flexibility (respect federalism)
4. Mandate evidence collection (enable iteration)

**The political moment is now**: 671 state bills in 2025, KOSA repeatedly passing Senate, and bipartisan consensus on child safety create unprecedented opportunity for federal action.

**The cost of inaction is democratic failure**: If we cannot govern transformative technologies, we cede power to corporate actors and allow a two-tiered system of digital rights to persist.
